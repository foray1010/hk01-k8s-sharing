@title[Why Container?]

Note:

### Old way

1. depends on OS package manager, all dependencies and their config are coupled

    - ex: like you won't share your node_modules for all projects right?
    - what if different node version is needed?

### New way

1. each containers are isolated from each other and the host, and having their own config, such as node version, timezone

1. portable

    - combinations can be infinite
